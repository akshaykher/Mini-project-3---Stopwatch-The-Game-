# Mini-project-3---Stopwatch-The-Game-

This project will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons. 

Finally, to turn your stopwatch into a test of reflexes, two numerical counters have been added that keep track of the number of times that you have stopped the watch and how many times you manage to stop the watch on a whole second (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.).
